# magento-minimal
Magento light weight installation without core modules related to e-commerce functionality. E-commerce modules are
not just disabled, all modules files are completely removed from installation, as well as modules dependencies.
This Magento installation has only CMS, Customers and basic system functionality, so now it can be used as platform
for any non e-commerce application. As a side effect of removing modules, it has very high performance. It is based on
Magento CE 1.9.0.1 and it can not be upgraded. 
Hey, if any one have some ideas about how to make it upgrade safe, please share!
